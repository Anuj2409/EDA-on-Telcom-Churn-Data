# EDA-on-Telcom-Churn-Data
This customer churn project is sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn]. We have seen many brilliant projects done on this dataset in terms of predictive modeling, but we are trying to explore the data visually and to see the hidden influence of bundling services had on customer churn using associate rule mining.
